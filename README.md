This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. Here's how to run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory, which mirrors the structure of the `src` directory. For example:

- Component tests: `src/__tests__/components/`
- Context tests: `src/__tests__/context/`

### Writing Tests

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Test component rendering
2. Test component interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
3. Test component props
4. Mock external dependencies (context, hooks, etc.)
